Experience and stories 

1. Created entire system from scratch by myself with design

2. Took KT and took ownership and resolved the original process

3. Optimized the process to complete the work in desired time



Programming Questions I solved

1. Given a matrix of positive integers/points. We have to start from lower left corner and reach the upper right corner. Our path should be such that we fetch maximum points. Only two movements are allowed- up and right, i.e. from a cell (R, C), you can either go to (R, C+1) or (R-1, C).

2. Write a function detectAndRemoveLoop() that checks whether a given Linked List contains loop and if loop is present then removes the loop and returns true. And if the list doesnâ€™t contain loop then returns false. Below diagram shows a linked list with a loop. detectAndRemoveLoop() must change the below list to 1->2->3->4->5->NULL. (Flyod Cycle Detection)

3.Given a binary string, that is it contains only 0s and 1s. We need to make this string a sequence of alternate characters by flipping some of the bits, our goal is to minimize the number of bits to be flipped.
